# Project objective

Use Tableau to visualize and investigate machine health across Daikibo's four factories to identify:

-- Which location experienced the most machine downtime?

-- Which machines were most affected in that location?

Tools used- Tableau

Step 1- Problem solving approach

-- Prepare the Dataset

-- Download the dataset file: daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip

-- Unzip the archive to extract the JSON file.

-- Open Tableau and import the JSON file.

Step 2- Create the 'Unhealthy' Metric

Navigate to the Data pane and create a calculated field:

Name: Unhealthy

Step 3- Visualize Factory-Level Downtime

-- Create a bar chart named: Down Time per Factory

-- Plot total Unhealthy minutes per Factory

Step 4- Visualize Machine-Type Downtime

-- Create a new sheet with a second bar chart named: Down Time per Device Type

-- Plot total Unhealthy minutes per Device Type

Step 5- Build an Interactive Dashboard

-- Combine both charts into a single Dashboard

-- Set the first chart (Factory) as a filter:

-- Selecting a factory will update the second chart to show only downtime for devices in that location

Step 6- Derive Insights & Submit

-- Click on the factory with the highest downtime in the first chart

-- Take a screenshot of the updated Dashboard
