ðŸ“Š Telemetry Data Overview

Daikibo has aggregated one monthâ€™s worth of telemetry data (May 2021) from its four manufacturing facilities:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo â€“ Tokyo, Japan

Daikibo Factory Seiko â€“ Osaka, Japan

Daikibo Berlin â€“ Berlin, Germany

Daikibo Shenzhen â€“ Shenzhen, China

Each factory operates 9 distinct machine types, each sending a telemetry message every 10 minutes. This resulted in a comprehensive dataset consolidated into a single JSON file.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The purpose of collecting this telemetry data was to answer two key operational questions:

Which factory location experienced the most machine failures?

Which specific machines broke down most frequently at that location?

This dataset provides a valuable opportunity for analytics, diagnostics, and visualization to support decision-making and operational improvements across Daikiboâ€™s global manufacturing network.
